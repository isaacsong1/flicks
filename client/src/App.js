// Goal for tomorrow:
// Create userSlice and understand it
// Create some components with JSX and get close to finishing many components
// Set myself up good for Monday so I am close to MVP's before the week starts

// Ideas for non-logged in user:
// View all movies and shows that are in the database (no fetch calls)
// Be able to generate random movie/show title to see if they wanna watch it
// No profile page
// No collection page
// No connect page

// For logged in user:
// View all movies and shows that are in the database (no fetch calls) with option to add to collection
// Be able to generate random movie/show title to see if they wanna watch it with option to add to collection
// Profile page, shows user information
// Collection page, shows collections with option to click into one and edit
// Connect page with option to follow
