# Flicks Updates

This file will be designated to version logs and future updates I can make. I am happy with the work I did during the bootcamp but I know there are plenty more improvements and features to make.

## Version 1.0:
### Authentication Page
- Input validators: Form cannot be submitted without typing (Must be an email @example.com, password must be at least 12 characters)
- Google Oauth Login: Alternative familiar login feature
- Minimal design. A better design could contribute to film theme with pictures/symbols

### Discover Page
- Buttons to switch from movie to shows (Could be changed to a toggle sliding button or combined together to show both movies and shows)
- Media Card: Minimal design, could use some transparency like IMDb website
- Generate Media button: Simple MUI button and animation, pressing button generates a new movie or show displayed in a card
- Dropdown Menu: Menu to select which collection to save media to (Uses MUI styling, could be improved)

### Connect Page
- Displays all users with option to follow/unfollow and click to see movies they have added (Modal design can look better, a hover design for viewing user's media, separate follow button from profile click, display user's follower/following count)
