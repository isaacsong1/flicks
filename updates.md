# Flicks Updates

This file will be designated to version logs and future updates I can make. I am happy with the work I did during the bootcamp but I know there are plenty more improvements and features to make.

## Version 1.0:
### Authentication Page - 
- Input validators: Form cannot be submitted without typing (Must be an email @example.com, password must be at least 12 characters)
- Google Oauth Login: Alternative familiar login feature
- Minimal design. A better design could contribute to film theme with pictures/symbols
